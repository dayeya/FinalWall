    <h1>FinalWall - An open-source web application firewall engine</h1>
</div>
Finalwall is an open-source WAF engine that is reliable, robust, and easy to use.
The engine provides significant models that make threat mitigation and network analysis easy.

# Installation

# Development
FinalWall is developed using Python 3.12 so previous versions are not supported. However, I suggest supporting 3.10+.
Below are the milestones of the project:

- [ ] Cross-Platform
- [X] Deploy FinalWall as a reverse proxy
- [X] Security and access log system
- [X] Client source control
- [X] Client profiling
- [X] ACL
- [X] Signature-based attack detection
- [X] Sqli
- [X] Unauthorized Access
- [X] Xss
- [ ] Bruteforce
- [ ] File Inclusion
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Simulations directory
- [ ] UI

Future milestones include:
- [ ] CSRF
- [ ] Bot detection
- [ ] Directory traversal
- [ ] Whitelisting

# Models and structure
The core engine of FinalWall is built from several models each of which takes on a variety of roles that ultimately make the system itself. 
Below are some of them: *Transactions, Events, 
Logs, Checks, Classifiers, Streams, SearchContexts, ProfileManager, and BanManager* are all a part of the core engine FinalWall is built on.
