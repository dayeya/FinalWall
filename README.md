# FinalWall
FinalWall is a public Open-Source Web application firewall module designed to be robust and secure for the community.

# Development
FinalWall is developed using Python 3.12 so previous versions are not supported. However, I would think about supporting 3.10+.
Below are the milestones of the project:

- [ ] Cross-Platform
- [X] Deploy FinalWall as a reverse proxy
- [X] Security and access log system
- [X] Client source control
- [X] Client profiling
- [X] ACL
- [X] Signature based attack detection
- [X] Sqli
- [X] Unauthorized Access
- [ ] Xss
- [ ] Bruteforce
- [ ] File inclusion
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Simulations directory
- [ ] UI

I aspire to work on that project in the future so future milestones include:
- [ ] CSRF
- [ ] Bot detection
- [ ] Directory traversal
- [ ] Whitelisting
