# NetGuard
This project aims to develop a robust and secure Web Application Firewall for websites.<br>
NetGuard detects, monitors, and protects websites from the following web attacks.

* Blind/No-Blind SQL Injection.
* Stored/Reflected XSS.
* CSRF
* File Inclusion.

# Configuration
NetGuard protects one website at a time.
This project uses a given website vulnerable to SQL Injection documented at [docs](https://github.com/dayeya/SQLi/blob/main/README.md).

# Attack detection and prevention
NetGuard uses built-in policies and rules to block malicious data. NetGuard supports dynamically added policies and uses whitelists and blacklists to strengthen its defensive capabilities.

# Database
In progress.

# Contributions
